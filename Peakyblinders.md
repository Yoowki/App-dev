### Antagonist 
- Inspector Chester Campbell: *Represents the corrupt face of authority. **He is a hypocritical and sadistic** figure who believes his brutal methods are justified, making him a terrifying and personal enemy for Tommy in the early seasons*

- Oswald Mosley: ***Arguably the most dangerous villain** due to his political influence and ideology. Based on the real-life historical figure, he represents a threat that cannot be defeated with gang violence alone, forcing Tommy into a complex political battle*

- Alfie Solomons: *A **fan-favorite antagonist** because of his unpredictable nature. As the charismatic leader of a Jewish gang in London, his relationship with Tommy is a constant dance of alliance and betrayal, making him a recurring and compelling threat*

### Fun facts about the series
Real-Life Inspiration [^1]

[^1]:  The series was inspired by creator Steven Knight's own family stories about growing up in Small Heath, Birmingham. His parents told him stories about a local gang called the Peaky Blinders

The Real Peaky Blinders [^2]

[^2]: The Peaky Blinders were a real urban youth gang based in Birmingham from the 1880s until the 1910s. The myth that they stitched razor blades into their caps is likely a misconception, as disposable razors were a luxury item at the time

Casting Almost Went Differently [^3]

[^3]: Jason Statham was initially considered for the role of Tommy Shelby. Cillian Murphy convinced creator Steven Knight by texting him, "Remember, I'm an actor," arguing he could transform into the role.

On-Set Family Ties [^4]

[^4]:  Actors Joe Cole (John Shelby) and Finn Cole (Michael Gray) are real-life brothers. Tom Hardy (Alfie Solomons) and Charlotte Riley (May Carleton) are married in real life.
